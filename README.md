Find the shortest path of the vertices

Find the shortest path between vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm 

Input: You can pick a city from google map and 10-15 locations as vertices

Your program will output the shortest path from the start vertex to all other vertices

Output: the answer can be verified from google map
